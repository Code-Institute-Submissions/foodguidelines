								At the beginning of the century, scientists managed to isolate the main components of 
                                food (Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen), which were connected to health. 
                                Justin Liebig, a German scientist, identified the chemical structure of carbohydrates, 
                                fats, and proteins.

                                Christiaan Eijkman was working with natives of Java who had developed the disease beriberi.

                                The Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare saw forced to develop the idea of 
                                "basic foods" that were both cheap and nutritious. This pressure was due  to the high food 
                                prices in the country back. The suggestion was a triangle in which the basic foods were at the base.

								Dr. James Lind made an experiment with sailors, who generally suffer from a deadly bleeding disorder,

								At the beginning of the century, scientists managed to isolate the main components of 
                                food (Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen), which were connected to health. 
                                Justin Liebig, a German scientist, identified the chemical structure of carbohydrates,

									Christiaan Eijkman was working with natives of Java who had developed the disease beriberi.

                                    Through his deduction, Eijkman discovered that changing the natives’ diet from white rice 
                                    to brown rice cured the beriberi. It was later discovered that the husk of the unprocessed

                                "basic foods" that were both cheap and nutritious. This pressure was due  to the high food 
                                prices in the country back. The suggestion was a triangle in which the basic foods were at the base.
