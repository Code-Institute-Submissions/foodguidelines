                            minerals and vitamins. However, they have very little protein and fat. Until recently, and due to the 
                            low caloric and protein intake of vegetables, they were considered as food products of relative interest. 
                            After the discovery of vitamins, these foods have become an important place in man's nutrition.

                            the cooking liquid. Whenever possible, vegetables should be cooked in the oven with their skin, 
                            and when it is necessary to cut them, it will be done in large portions to achieve the smallest

                            the body and is the major structural component of all cells in the body, especially muscle.

                            in some systems, the digestibility of the protein source.
